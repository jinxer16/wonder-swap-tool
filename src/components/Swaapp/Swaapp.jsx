              As we expand this ecosystem, we will address major concerns that investors encounter. We will essentially remove all sponsor fees, providing all investors with proportionately better returns and more depreciation. We will run every real estate syndicate through a DAO, which will allow investors to be more involved in property decisions.

              AR and VR have been around for many years and have been extensively employed for immersive gaming experiences. The use of these technologies in Metaverse is clear, and both the Metaverse and immersive tech will continue to expand.AI in Metaverse can be used to produce non-player characters, according to the Top Technologies Shaping Metaverse (NPCs). With AI's processing skills, NPCs can be placed across the 3D environments to enable lifelike conversations with users or can be utilised to do other particular jobs.
